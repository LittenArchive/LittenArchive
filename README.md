## Archive of Litten Tweaks

### Background

Litten is a talented jailbreak developer who unfortunately left the community.

An older version of this repository archived compiled versions of Litten's tweaks. However,
realizing that the source code of many of Litten's tweaks states that one
"may not redistribute... packages from it", that archive has been replaced with this one.

### Purpose

Litten has generously provided the source code of their packages via GitHub public repositories,
most of which are still up at the time of writing, which have been forked by this account
for preservation (in accordance with the Terms of Service):

> If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub
a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub
Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality
(for example, through forking).
